Hackathons encourage developers to collaborate and develop utilities, ideas, running code and solutions that show practical implementations of IETF standards. This is also an excellent mechanism to participate in IETF by bringing in the implementation experience and providing useful comments to, in-progress standards.

Suggested Project/ Technologies Areas - 
- IOT
- Security/TLS
- SDN

- QUIC/HTTP 2.0

Requirements for Hackathon Participants -
- Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
- Some projects may require installing additional software
- Familiarity with the technology area(s) in which you plan to participate will certainly help
- Your laptop is the default development platform for each technology
- Anything else that is required will be provided, such as VMs you can install on our laptop or access from your laptop
- Installing and becoming familiar with VirtualBox or something similar will help
- Note to champions: if planning to make use of VMs, please bring on USB drives to make available to others as download times -can be painful
- Specific coding languages are called out for some of projects (e.g. Python, Java), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s)
